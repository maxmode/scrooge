Feedback from Product Owner
==========
(based on true story)



1. Remove mosaic view in lists - as it looks strange and un-styled.
 
2. Pagination in lists should have possible values: 10, 25, 100, 500. 
By default should be displayed 25 items per page

3. Export should return the same fields like in listview.

4. Date format in listview and export: yyyy-mm-dd.

5. Fix Date field.
Default value for date - today.
It should be a datepicker.

6. Side menu admin.
List of transactions should be available from Treasure detail page.

7.	Fix breadcrumbs.
On edit page breadcrumbs show weird characters.
Also titles in breadcrumbs should be translated.

8. Column width in list view for Treasure Type.
Columns should have widths: 40%, 20%, 20%, 20%

9. Rename project and fix translations on Dashboard.

10. New requirement.
We need new mandatory field "Picture URL" for Treasure Type.
On the overview it should be displayed in column together with title.

11. Add useful filters for Transaction list:
Date range, operation type, treasure type

12. Format for money everywhere: $10,000,000.00
